# Source SDK 2013 BDS Base

This is a Source SDK 2013 fork made for the purpose of giving a reliable mod base for currently updated and future Bitl Development Studio (BDS) mod projects.
This was based off the TF2 SDK release, and will be updated as the SDK updates.

This will feature sources for some currently updated and future Bitl Development Studio (BDS) mod projects.

## Features:
- Restored game project generator scripts. No more having to generate every project!
- Implements various pull requests from the master repo, allowing for a stable and reliable mod base.
- Build scripts for Half-Life 2, Lost Coast and HL2 episodes.
- NextBot support for the singleplayer games, with additional NPC sensing support from FIREFIGHT RELOADED.
- Integrated Python binaries (on Windows) for more simple buiding.
